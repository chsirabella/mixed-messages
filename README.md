# mixed-messages

"Mixed Messages" is the first portfolio project in Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer Career Path" course. The idea for the project was to build a message generator program that gives the user a new, randomized output each time they run it.

This version of "Mixed Messages" is baseball-themed. It pulls from a list of top MLB players and generates a trade between two random teams.
